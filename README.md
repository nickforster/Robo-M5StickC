# Robo M5StickC
This is a school project in which we used the Zumo 32U4 Robot and the M5 Stick C. To connect them together we used 6 wires on which there either is electricity or not. Based on that we got 32 states to have different dirrections ans speeds for the robot. Further we made a website with a joystick for the M5 Stick C, where we can control the robot.
